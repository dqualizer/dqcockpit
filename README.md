# dqcockpit
The dqcockpit components offers a (readonly) dashboard visualizing the results of executed RQAs and a management overview dashboard that displays the current system state based on automatically extracted analysis data which is translated to the domain level.

A more detailed description of this component's architecture is provided in the [arc42 document](https://dqualizer.github.io/dqualizer).
